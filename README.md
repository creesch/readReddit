Readable text posts on reddit
========================

Reformat text posts into a nice readable format without any distractions. Currently it does this by grabbing the text of the post and putting it in a nice overlay that blocks out the rest of the page and formats the text to have a nice balance in font size, line height and line width. 

Features:

- Will also go over comments to look for first level comments by the author to include these in the formatted text. Useful for those text posts where the author runs out of space and continues their story in the comments.
- Light and dark mode. 

Future: 

- Custom theme creation. 
- Choose your own font.
- Adjust the font size.
- Adjust the text width. Currently it set to roughly go for 50-70 characters per line which studies have shown to be ideal. But some people are stubborn so this likely will need to be a setting at some point ;) 
- Make the extension also easy to use on subreddits where comments are the focus (writingPrompts for example).
