Readable text posts on reddit
========================
readReddit adds a pleasant & clutter free reading mode for reddit text posts and comments.

Reformat text posts from this:  
![Before](https://www.creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c37109ddbe6c.png)

Into a nice readable format without any distractions. Like this:

![After](https://www.creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c3710ca05f08.png)

Or if you are more into dark themes: 

![After dark](https://www.creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c3710f5dd1c4.png)

Or do the same for all top level comments in subreddits like /r/WritingPrompts.

Activated from a simple floating button. ![Floating button](https://www.creesch.com/dump/img/img_5c3a30f3538b5.png)
